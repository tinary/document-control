# Document Control App

## Background

This is a prototype I created for a project at my workplace. The prototype was implemented into an inhouse enterprise system and connects to a third-party product management documentation system. For confidentiality and simplicity, I have simplified the code to use simple database data and to show how it works.

## Summary
This document control application allows user to upload purchase order and view the upload file. User can also search document by the purchase order number and view the document. The program allows user to upload any valid documents, the program will save the document to a database with any MIME type and display the appropriate document on the application interface.

The application requires a database to save the blob object.

Technology used in the project: C#, ASP.NET Model–view–controller, SQL Server, IIS Express
